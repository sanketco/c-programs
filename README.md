# c-programs
it is function based c-programs
questions are given below:

1. Write a program to find the largest digit in a number. Use a function
that takes an integer number as an argument.

2. Write a program to print the sum of 1+2+3+...+n. Use a function with
limit as the argument.

3. Write a program that accepts three numbers and using a function returns
the largest among the numbers.

4. Write a program that reads two numbers and swaps them using a
function.

5. Write a program that reads a number and finds the factorial using a
function that takes an integer number.

6. Write a menu driven program with the following menus:-
1. Add
2. Difference
3. Product
4. Division
Use functions for each of the menu with proper arguments, return type
and function name.

7. Write a menu driven program with the following menus:-
1. Area of circle
2. Perimeter of circle
3. Area of rectangle
4. Perimeter of a rectangle
Use functions for each of the menu with proper arguments, return type
and function name.

8. Write a program to find the sum of series 1/1!+4/2!+27/3!+... Use
appropriate functions to find the sum of the series.

9. Write a function that converts temperature given in Celsius to Fahrenheit.

10. Write a function to calculate compound interest given the principal, rate
of interest and number of years.

11. Write a function to calculate x y where y is an integer.

12. Write a function to print the first n terms of the Fibonacci series.

13. Print the prime factors of a given number using a function.

14. Write C code , including a loop, required to calculate y(t) from the
equation:
       3t + 5, t < 0
y(t) = −3t + 5, t ≥ 0
for values of t between -9 and 9 in steps of 3. Display each value of t and
y(t).

15. Write a complete C program that does the following.
It asks the user to enter an integer between 100 and 9999. If the entered
number is out of range, the program forces the user to enter more numbers
until one in the correct range is given. Then the program prints the digits
in the number (in reverse) on separate lines. Here is an example of how the
program should work:
Enter an integer between 100 and 9999: 897
7
9

16. The following types of chocolates are available in a chocolate shop. Write
a menu driven program to display the chocolate type, price and discount.
Get the customer’s choice and the number of chocolates required. Assume
that each customer can buy only one type of chocolate. Use switch_case to
calculate the total amount with discount for each customer and display it.
Use a function to calculate total amount. Also keep track of how many
of each type of chocolate was sold throughout the day and print it using
a function.
Slno Chocolate Type             Price(Rs.) Discount (%)
1     White Chocolate              50         10
2     Dark Chocolate               60         12
3      Raw Chocolate               42         6
4     Bittersweet Chocolate        55         8

17. Write a function to print the first n terms of the following series:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 22, 26, 38, 62, 74, 102, 104, 108, 116, 122, 126, 138, ...
To get each term in the above series you have to multiply all the non-zero
digits of previous number and then add that value to previous number. Thus
with a value like 62, you multiply 6 x 2 and get 12. Now 62 + 12 = 74,
which is the next value in the sequence?

18. Write a function to print the numbers in a given range whose sum of the
factorials of all its digits is equal to the number itself.
For example: 145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

19. Write a C program to print all the non-Fibonacci numbers using a
function up to a particular limit n. For example if n is 10 your program
should display 4, 6, 7, 9, 10. Do not use arrays in the program.

20. Write a complete C program that reads an integer n and computes and
prints the first n terms of the following series using a function.
a 1 = 1, a 2 = 2, a 3 = 3, and for k > 3 : a k = a k−2 + 2 × a k−3 .
Assume n > 0. Do not use arrays.
Below is the output from a sample run of the program:
Enter n: 7
Output : 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 15

21. Using call by reference swap two numbers.

22. Using call by reference find the sum of two numbers.

23. Find factorial of a number using a recursive function

24. Find gcd of a number using a recursive function.

25. Find product of two numbers using a recursive function.

26. Find power of a number using a recursive function.

27. Find the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive function.

28. Convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent using a recursive
function.

29. Define a recursive function for reversing a number or printing the sum of
digits of a number using a user choice.

30. A child is running up a ladder with n steps, and can hop either 1 step or 2
steps at a time. Calculate how many possible ways the child can run up
the ladder.
